## Intro

Chef Claude is an interactive, React-based web application designed to simplify meal planning by generating recipes based on available ingredients. The mission? Help users turn a simple pantry list into a delicious, chef-recommended meal.

The application's key features include an ingredient input that allows users to add items like tomato, pasta, and meatballs to a dynamic list. Once at least four ingredients are added, the "Get a recipe" feature becomes available. The app provides smart recommendations by suggesting classic dishes—such as Classic Spaghetti and Meatballs—along with a full list of measurements and step-by-step instructions.
